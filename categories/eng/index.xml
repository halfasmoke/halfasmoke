In a world where Fire is fundamental&amp;hellip;
There’s a man, the chosen one they called him, carrying out a task&amp;hellip; an old prophecy.
“&amp;hellip;maketh pilgrimage to the land of Ancient Lords…
…When thou ringeth the Bell of Awakening, fate, thou shalt know&amp;hellip;”
Set foot into the land of Ancient lords whose throne forsaken and slowly fall into obscurity. Encountered countless decaying skeletons, senseless undeads, horrendous monsters, even dragons. Fought them all.</description>

the greatest challenge of all is not to overcome obstacles or running through some milestones it is to face oneself in the nothingness, the abyss, to look inward within oneself, to dive deep, to search for what lies underneath not just the tip of the iceberg
because&amp;hellip; the abyss is all around us
suppose one day you&amp;rsquo;re happily strolling in the street or mistakenly counting your steps on a drunken night out</description>

I struggle with happiness..
I think we all do.. and I don&amp;rsquo;t think a lot of people talk about it because&amp;hellip; There&amp;rsquo;s no in between!
I think it&amp;rsquo;s either you&amp;rsquo;re happy or you&amp;rsquo;re depressed! But what if you&amp;rsquo;re just fine?
There&amp;rsquo;s times where I feel really happy but at that time I also know this is temporary and I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go back to just fine. And there&amp;rsquo;s times where I feel unhappy and I know it&amp;rsquo;s gonna go back to normal.</description>
