you are a mirror, when i look into you and stare at your soul. i know and learn to love myself&amp;hellip;
&amp;ndash;
it’s all scatter everywhere, a mess
and all of this are nothing but scatter pieces
no beginning nor ending
even a puzzle have collected pieces
a place for each piece,
meant to be in that place
&amp;ndash;
if one person doens&amp;rsquo;t have those thoughts anymore, would them still be the same person?</description>

      <description>-
It all began on top of the hill, excited and fun, and slowly slided down until they reached the ‘valley of despair’ where all they can see is nothing but fog, mist, dark, and not everyone can get out of it, hence the name.
But those who keep rolling despite the heavy baggage, the string, pulling them back, those who have strength, courage will see the end of it, that is, a glimpse of hope in the form of a light beam shining down on their path.</description>

He was laying, turning his body around and around to find a comfortable position to sleep. Yesterday he slept like a snail, curled everything up, the day before, a vampire, with both his arms and legs straight out, and the day before that, a butterfly, tomorrow maybe a giraffe, standing. Every time he found it, he only had one wish.
He wishes to have a bullet fired through his head to make them stop running or a sword pierced through his heart to make it stop feeling.</description>

      <description>-
Childhood isn&amp;rsquo;t in some of those photographs, isn&amp;rsquo;t in those places you used to visit. It is when a familiar aroma suddenly hits your nose that makes you remember your mother&amp;rsquo;s breakfast, a familiar scent of the newly built house that makes you remember going out with your father to buy cement for your new home. A sudden scene of those kids playing with dirt makes you remember when you sneaked out to catch crickets with your friends at night.</description>

      <description>-
time like this, usually they have two windows, one to see out side and another to the world.
and those who that don&amp;rsquo;t have the latter, they carry themselves with a vivid imagination. with only a tree, they can tell others stories, and with only one beam of light, they can see the sun.
they must be the strongest of all to make it through this time of life, but will those imagination ever stop running, and creating such lively images.</description>

      <description>-
When there is no solution yet to be found, escapism will become king, a cruel one. But one will not see the king at first hand, his loyal servant - &amp;lsquo;denial&amp;rsquo; will stand at the gate, perhaps, ready for a fight if one persists in meeting a king.
All that to the question: what will the king do?
If one has the strength and courage to defeat such “a being”, a hidden door behind his throne will lead one to freedom, liberation, and clarity as well as stillness in one’s mind - become the hero in the midst of ordinary with power to create the extraordinary.</description>

one time we had a dance
maybe you think that was nothing
and maybe that was by chance
but i remember it despite my bad memory
every footstep, backward and forward
in every note of that song
but i guess i was late
alone, i have to solve this crossword
this is no Careless whisper
but the tune sings loudly in my head
maybe in the bleak midwinter
i’ll play the song again on my old cassette</description>

Suppose you came back from where that took something from you or everything. The one who came back was not the one who walked in and what after that is just some extra time that they gave to you.
Some may take that time and do something crazy or stupid, some may take it to create the extraordinary or close to the extraordinary. Either way, it isn&amp;rsquo;t bad if you look at it, they all prepare to immerse themselves in the nothingness, that is, death.</description>

I am a picture but try telling a story
You are a story but try painting an album
We are living in the same world
But seem to be from two different one
Is it funny, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?
Just like
small lizard in the rain
oh how did he get there
with the house he&amp;rsquo;s been crawling on
cannot seem to find a home
with all the food he&amp;rsquo;s been stepping on</description>

      <description>-
a child stops smiling
a woman goes silence
a man never came back
the wind, raging, yelling
the cloud, pouring down the soil
the moon, turned dark
teardrops, swallowed the sun
the bird, now swimming
fingers, turned into matches
water, turned into oxygen
and ignited its very own soul
but there&amp;rsquo;s still another side of the mirror
and the sky is pretty much blue over here&amp;hellip;

there are a lot of words to be said but none shall hear for all she ever did was write them down in that paper sheet and burn it afterwards.
those ashes&amp;hellip;flying, flowing mid-air, circling around her as if they are singing to her ears, and saying those words back to her, telling her own stories.
that is a ritual she loves to do when her voice cracks, her throat thickens, and when she is all by herself, and when she types the last word of each page.</description>

&amp;ldquo;If only you could answer,
If only your heart had courage to lift itself up and take a chance.
The promise of luminous eyes,
Beyond the dark curtain of my hollow soul&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
why does oneself can see such a beautiful thing?
maybe because now, in one&amp;rsquo;s mind, something has opened, and something has awaken&amp;hellip;
or it&amp;rsquo;s already there to be read.
the bridge has once again, presented

Ever wonder that film, music, and books are made to sympathize your feeling that your person could not?
&amp;ndash;
Suppose you made a deal with a demon to exchange your soul for some incredible power.
But it would be funny if someone want a soul in exchange for its incredible power&amp;hellip; Can a demon capable of doing such thing?

      <description>-
telling a story is like painting a picture.
starting with a simple point, then a line, sometimes a curve, adding colour, favorite colour, good one, bad one just to make it diverse.
some may call it good, some may add a few details, and some may even tear the whole canvas apart. but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter because paint can be drawn again, all the line, the curve, the detail are already there, and the original exists nowhere else but within the painter.</description>

A man was taking a stroll after dinner as usual then saw a small bar with an interesting name and decided to go in. The bar seems amusing but strangely no one there but the owner.
He sat down at the counter. After a few drinks, he told the bartender
“You know what would be funny? It’s able to take your heart out, hold it in your hand and see it beating slowly, but the mind thinks it already died a long time ago.</description>

There it goes, away it goes
The day goes by and something talking with nothing
Maybe expecting plays out too much
Maybe hope is persevering
A little jazz playing there
A little blue in this bottle
A little fish swimming slowly
The old train forgot direction to the castle
Angel wings are dropping, so seemingly

upon landing, at the pit, lost and confused, i saw the rope, one single hanging rope, not sure where this will lead to but climb it anyway.

Everyday is the same, he follows a structure, a pattern which he knows perfectly well, as if he pushes a stone up a mountain just to see the stone rolls down and tomorrow will be the same, rarely a peak of joyfulness but that surely keeps his soul intact.
He seems to have things which anyone will find contentment ?

it&amp;rsquo;s sure the world keeps the moon in the sky,
and the sun deeps in the ocean.
but the moon is no more,
the sun has let out its last light beam,
only eternal darkness growing, rapidly.
but what is darkness without light
maybe light itself is just darkness in disguise
to give them a false sense of hope,
that is,
tomorrow is a new day,
yesterday was a mistake,</description>

the term “just for fun” implied the existence of “just for sad”
Suppose one day, you go to the mountain just to sit down, watch the sky, and observe.
Spot a lonely tree has its root deep into the soil of an isolated hill - feel the sadness just for the sake of it.
Spot a solo flying bird and a single beam of sunlight shining over it as if it was guidance to the nest - feel the sadness just for the sake of it.</description>

Life is brilliant. Beautiful. It enchants us, to the point of obsession.
Some are true to their purpose, though they are but shells, flesh and mind.
One man lost his own body, but lingered on, as a head.
Others chase the charms of love, however elusive.
Peace grants men the illusion of life.
Shackled by falsehoods, they yearn for love, unaware of its grand illusion.
Until, the curse touches their flesh.</description>

Watching some extraordinary film to feel less ordinary, when that two hours of goodness ended, the train takes you back to your homeland. Everything you do is too normal to the point that makes you hate it, but that’s not the end, living with the thing you hate turned out that you slowly love them.
And from that moment on, you don’t have to revolt against it anymore, it has become your greatest ally that no person in the world could match its strengths or even weaknesses.</description>

In endless realm of nothingness, obscure darkness
Exists something ethereal, unfathomable yet seemingly wondrous
Soul
Floating mindlessly, and…
One found another amongst the many
Stumbled upon each others
Somehow, in some way miraculously and strangely
Regardless
Let those unify
Resonate in frequency, echo through eternity
Then let those wander in the midst of stars
Delicately
Circling around the sun, dallying
Delight in the warmth, the golden gleam
Tastefulness in all between</description>

to drink is
to forget something
to remember something
to make something happen
to wish of undone something
to feel what word failed to say
and to see what action failed to do
drink once to this
drink twice to that
drink finite to the infinite

The rare is indeed for the rare
But is it wrong to change one&amp;rsquo;s surroundings? one always have the power to do as such
It could be the way one&amp;rsquo;s trust is different and the way one choose to filter out the rare
One might encounter some might be glad to water the soil, or even poison the air, but that’s the risk one is willing to take, isn&amp;rsquo;t it so?</description>

If you wanna swim in the ocean of laughter, do this
but be careful for the regretting shark
If you wanna unlock the hidden memories, do this
but be careful ‘cause there’s no guidance
If you wanna see how much you’ve grown, do this
but be careful for your own ignorance
If you wanna feel something other than nothing, do this
but be careful for the rabbit, do not chase the rabbit</description>

what makes something bearutiful? is it the existence of the opposite - ugly?
but then what makes the thing ugly or unpleasant?
or is it always a beauty that exists in the observer&amp;rsquo;s eyes?
never seen the face never seen the smile
just a glimpse
not eyes but only one
enough to say
&amp;ldquo;Ah, beauty&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
eh?

Longing for freedom
the one that allows us to fully express ourselves, to the endless sky, soaring with the wind, absorbing the warm sunlight, to emerge oneself with the earth, liberation
like a kite, flying with all of its wills
But it is all but an illusion for a kite has a string
A string help it fly, and at some point, will pull it back, put in a closet</description>

he saw it many times but this time, he had it, held it only to be pricked by its thorns and given a warning not to come near&amp;hellip;
he can only watch from afar now
Watching it bloom with all of its flawless beauty in the dawn, letting sunlight slips through its petals delicately
&amp;hellip;and so the thought, maybe he is this way, maybe just to observe, maybe a watcher, a mere audience sometimes feels warm in his chest and silently enrichs the soil</description>

Couldn’t remember, because&amp;hellip;
Alive every sunshine but each is a different character and a different world and in each of which, he must die.
Last night was a pirate, drowned, the day before was a cheerful old grandma, died of old age&amp;hellip;</description>

a man with a boat in the middle of the lake is an act of freedom
slowly rowing his boat aimlessly in the midst of waves,
not necessarily knowing where to but in the man&amp;rsquo;s mind,
he knows exactly where the destination is,
solely because it is his boat.
not necessarily requiring companion or friend,
he knows exactly how to keep him sane,
solely because he himself, is at peace,</description>

he is a wolf chasing his moon
every night, he howls, hopefully.
climbing mounts and wanting
the moon to be closer.
and one time, drinking water in a lake nearby,
he stumbled upon the moon reflection.
sat down and started gazing at its whiteness beauty
and he singed his favourite song to it,
waves washed on his feet as if the moon is listening to his tunes.
after singing his final note and without hesitation,</description>

Link the fire to extend the age of Light or let it fade to introduce the age of men, dark. But in the age of dark, embers will dance, and once again, fire will be rekindled.
But whether to do or not to do, a loop is always created.
A circle that has no end nor beginning, a mere absurdity will bring every action to a halt.
There is no right answer nor there is wrong, it just is.</description>

Going left is only right in some cases and going right is only right in some cases. Whether to choose to go left or right solely depends on the occasion and circumstances.
What if one chooses to stay in the middle and wait for the situation to act, to choose which path, left or right? But choosing to stay is also choosing to go either left or right, in a bigger picture, thus creating infinite paths, infinite choices in one&amp;rsquo;s mind.</description>

Everyday he counts his steps while walking to the four walls of contentment, missed one step he thought but it&amp;rsquo;s matter not as he unlocking the door.</description>

I struggle with happiness..
I think we all do.. and I don&amp;rsquo;t think a lot of people talk about it because&amp;hellip; There&amp;rsquo;s no in between!
I think it&amp;rsquo;s either you&amp;rsquo;re happy or you&amp;rsquo;re depressed! But what if you&amp;rsquo;re just fine?
There&amp;rsquo;s times where I feel really happy but at that time I also know this is temporary and I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go back to just fine. And there&amp;rsquo;s times where I feel unhappy and I know it&amp;rsquo;s gonna go back to normal.</description>
