A million voices scream every day, a million voices want to be heard, a million stories want to be told but not a single ear wants to listen, then those screams turned into silence, those stories were forced to cut their own words. Thus, creates a void of stillness like a lake in the bleak winter, with only eyes left to look at one after another, time itself froze at the bottomless lake.</description>

He can only find it in between of things, between the honking sound of one car and another, between the ticking second of a traffic light when he looked at it, between the finished task to another beginning, between each sip of coffee and finally between the consolatory silence.
He is in war with no one other than himself, he wants something which cannot exist, his war but in peace.</description>

A young man who always feels he doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong, every where he went, he felt a sense of disconnect, disconnect with his surrounding, his people, sometimes his mind as if he hungry for a place of his own, his own trees howling in the wind, his own moon&amp;rsquo;s reflection on a quiet lake, his own sun circling around him..his own people.
Everyday he counts his steps while walking to the four walls of contentment, missed one step he thought but it&amp;rsquo;s matter not as he unlocking the door.</description>

everyday she is granted a key to a room
she went in
one time she was so happy and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to leave
one time she couldn&amp;rsquo;t move even a finger upon entering
one time she was so frightened by all the pictures hanged on the wall
one time she just smiled and left
one time she didn&amp;rsquo;t enter any room, she sat down and looked, looked around, looked inward, inside of her and suddenly around her was filled with&amp;hellip;</description>

All this time in my head there was a question, one question can turn everything seems joyful into gloomy, cleverness into sadness and happiness into despair.
I long for an answer, a direction, or simply a guideline to set out&amp;hellip;
as you may guess, I found it, found the answer, THE answer
that is, my effort, my attempt, my endeavor was less than the meaningless and the nothingness itself.</description>

man searching for his soul
&amp;ldquo;who leaves can never return and for those who stay will receive eternal joy&amp;rdquo; that was what he saw at the door when he&amp;rsquo;s pondering on his decision whether to stay or to leave
&amp;ldquo;to fill, must, to break&amp;rdquo; he heard that long ago from an old man and that night, he couldn&amp;rsquo;t sleep, he was thinking but he couldn&amp;rsquo;t say anything, to her</description>

let me tell you a story about a man
every night he shuts his eyes, he saw himself standing in a room, a space, an area, whatever but there is nothing but himself
and every time he&amp;rsquo;s in there, he was forced to play&amp;hellip;
he played his memories back and forth
he played those pictures as a movie
he played those words as a sentence
he played those tunes as a song</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m in a room, that unforgettable room
lighted a cigarette
and they&amp;rsquo;re coming at me, good and bad
it&amp;rsquo;s ok, I want them to
pieces of broken vase, by accident, floating and scratching the air
&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;don&amp;rsquo;t be sorry&amp;rdquo;
opening a window, too much smoke
sitting up there, contemplating
all the noise, TV, fans, bikes down the street, birds in a room&amp;hellip;?
but I can only hear the silence between them</description>

In a world where Fire is fundamental&amp;hellip;
There’s a man, the chosen one they called him, carrying out a task&amp;hellip; an old prophecy.
“&amp;hellip;maketh pilgrimage to the land of Ancient Lords…
…When thou ringeth the Bell of Awakening, fate, thou shalt know&amp;hellip;”
Set foot into the land of Ancient lords whose throne forsaken and slowly fall into obscurity. Encountered countless decaying skeletons, senseless undeads, horrendous monsters, even dragons. Fought them all.</description>

close my eyes
i feel my head hurt, then it stop
i hear my heart pounding, non-stop
i smell a familiar scent
but
i see nothing, bleak black
for i walked into the abyss
alone like everyone else
but&amp;hellip;
with nothing in hands and barefooted
returned
but the man who walked in was never return
no one ever return the same
it got something of us all
it got something</description>

      <description>-
the greatest challenge of all is not to overcome obstacles or running through some milestones
it is to face oneself in the nothingness, the abyss, to look inward within oneself, to dive deep, to search for what lies underneath not just the tip of the iceberg
because&amp;hellip; the abyss is all around us
suppose one day you&amp;rsquo;re happily strolling in the street or mistakenly counting your steps on a drunken night out</description>

I struggle with happiness..
I think we all do.. and I don&amp;rsquo;t think a lot of people talk about it because&amp;hellip; There&amp;rsquo;s no in between!
I think it&amp;rsquo;s either you&amp;rsquo;re happy or you&amp;rsquo;re depressed! But what if you&amp;rsquo;re just fine?
There&amp;rsquo;s times where I feel really happy but at that time I also know this is temporary and I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go back to just fine. And there&amp;rsquo;s times where I feel unhappy and I know it&amp;rsquo;s gonna go back to normal.</description>
