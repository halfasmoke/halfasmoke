Longing for freedom
the one that allows us to fully express ourselves, to the endless sky, soaring with the wind, absorbing the warm sunlight, to emerge oneself with the earth, liberation
like a kite, flying with all of its wills
But it is all but an illusion for a kite has a string
A string help it fly, and at some point, will pull it back, put in a closet</description>

it began as a mistake‚Ä¶
a corpse
Lying in the field with nothing but the dust blowing wind and sometimes the smell of burning nearby friends
Was he the bartender pouring his drink last night?
Was she the woman who slapped him last night?
Couldn‚Äôt remember, because&amp;hellip;
Alive every sunshine but each is a different character and a different world and in each of which, he must die.
Last night was a pirate, drowned, the day before was a cheerful old grandma, died of old age&amp;hellip;</description>

he is a wolf chasing his moon
every night, he howls, hopefully.
climbing mounts and wanting
the moon to be closer.
and one time, drinking water in a lake nearby,
he stumbled upon the moon reflection.
sat down and started gazing at its whiteness beauty
and he singed his favourite song to it,
waves washed on his feet as if the moon is listening to his tunes.
after singing his final note and without hesitation,</description>

Link the fire to extend the age of Light or let it fade to introduce the age of men, dark. But in the age of dark, embers will dance, and once again, fire will be rekindled.
But whether to do or not to do, a loop is always created.
A circle that has no end nor beginning, a mere absurdity will bring every action to a halt.
There is no right answer nor there is wrong, it just is.</description>

‚ÄòOnly in truth, the lords will abandon their thrones‚Äô
Souls of lords he‚Äôs gathered, five lords sit on their five thrones, now the final battle has approached. But he has something that was meant to be hidden, far away from the world, lurking itself in the frightful image of the abandoned realm. The eyes of a Fire Keeper‚Ä¶
‚Äò‚Ä¶ but Fire Keepers are not meant to have eyes.

barmaid: ‚ÄúLast day, huh?‚Äù
ashen one: ‚ÄúI guess so‚Äù
barmaid: ‚ÄúHave something to say, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù
ashen one: ‚Äú *sigh * I think I dug myself a hole so deep that now I am lost under the ground, too far down from the surface, worse than that, I‚Äôve been there for too long and the comfort is growing within myself. I no longer long for a way out but at the same time I can sense a tiny fracture of myself screaming, stretching to the sky but all of that, all the effort were in vain and so close to the edge of hopelessness.</description>

A million voices scream every day, a million voices want to be heard, a million stories want to be told but not a single ear wants to listen, then those screams turned into silence, those stories were forced to cut their own words. Thus, creates a void of stillness like a lake in the bleak winter, with only eyes left to look at one after another, time itself froze at the bottomless lake.</description>

He can only find it in between of things, between the honking sound of one car and another, between the ticking second of a traffic light when he looked at it, between the finished task to another beginning, between each sip of coffee and finally between the consolatory silence.
He is in war with no one other than himself, he wants something which cannot exist, his war but in peace.</description>

A young man who always feels he doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong, every where he went, he felt a sense of disconnect, disconnect with his surrounding, his people, sometimes his mind as if he hungry for a place of his own, his own trees howling in the wind, his own moon&amp;rsquo;s reflection on a quiet lake, his own sun circling around him..his own people.
Everyday he counts his steps while walking to the four walls of contentment, missed one step he thought but it&amp;rsquo;s matter not as he unlocking the door.</description>

everyday she is granted a key to a room
she went in
one time she was so happy and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to leave
one time she couldn&amp;rsquo;t move even a finger upon entering
one time she was so frightened by all the pictures hanged on the wall
one time she just smiled and left
one time she didn&amp;rsquo;t enter any room, she sat down and looked, looked around, looked inward, inside of her and suddenly around her was filled with&amp;hellip;</description>

All this time in my head there was a question, one question can turn everything seems joyful into gloomy, cleverness into sadness and happiness into despair.
I long for an answer, a direction, or simply a guideline to set out&amp;hellip;
as you may guess, I found it, found the answer, THE answer
that is, my effort, my attempt, my endeavor was less than the meaningless and the nothingness itself.</description>

let me tell you a story about a man
every night he shuts his eyes, he saw himself standing in a room, a space, an area, whatever but there is nothing but himself
and every time he&amp;rsquo;s in there, he was forced to play&amp;hellip;
he played his memories back and forth
he played those pictures as a movie
he played those words as a sentence
he played those tunes as a song</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m in a room, that unforgettable room
lighted a cigarette
and they&amp;rsquo;re coming at me, good and bad
it&amp;rsquo;s ok, I want them to
pieces of broken vase, by accident, floating and scratching the air
&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;don&amp;rsquo;t be sorry&amp;rdquo;
opening a window, too much smoke
sitting up there, contemplating
all the noise, TV, fans, bikes down the street, birds in a room&amp;hellip;?
but I can only hear the silence between them</description>

In a world where Fire is fundamental&amp;hellip;
There‚Äôs a man, the chosen one they called him, carrying out a task&amp;hellip; an old prophecy.
‚Äú&amp;hellip;maketh pilgrimage to the land of Ancient Lords‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶When thou ringeth the Bell of Awakening, fate, thou shalt know&amp;hellip;‚Äù
Set foot into the land of Ancient lords whose throne forsaken and slowly fall into obscurity. Encountered countless decaying skeletons, senseless undeads, horrendous monsters, even dragons. Fought them all.</description>

close my eyes
i feel my head hurt, then it stop
i hear my heart pounding, non-stop
i smell a familiar scent
but
i see nothing, bleak black
for i walked into the abyss
alone like everyone else
but&amp;hellip;
with nothing in hands and barefooted
returned
but the man who walked in was never return
no one ever return the same
it got something of us all

the greatest challenge of all is not to overcome obstacles or running through some milestones
it is to face oneself in the nothingness, the abyss, to look inward within oneself, to dive deep, to search for what lies underneath not just the tip of the iceberg
because&amp;hellip; the abyss is all around us
suppose one day you&amp;rsquo;re happily strolling in the street or mistakenly counting your steps on a drunken night out</description>

I struggle with happiness..
I think we all do.. and I don&amp;rsquo;t think a lot of people talk about it because&amp;hellip; There&amp;rsquo;s no in between!
I think it&amp;rsquo;s either you&amp;rsquo;re happy or you&amp;rsquo;re depressed! But what if you&amp;rsquo;re just fine?
There&amp;rsquo;s times where I feel really happy but at that time I also know this is temporary and I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go back to just fine. And there&amp;rsquo;s times where I feel unhappy and I know it&amp;rsquo;s gonna go back to normal.</description>
